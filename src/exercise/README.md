# Exercises to create new operation in TensorFlow

## Ex 1
Take in input a 3D tensor and copy it in the output

## Ex 2
Take in input a 3D tensor and replicate it to create a 4D tensor in output

## Ex 3
Same as Ex 2 but accept multiple inputs. Therefore the input is 4D tensor
and the output is 5D

## Ex 4
Pixel selector
